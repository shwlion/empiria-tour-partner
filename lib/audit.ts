/**
 * The audit trail — B3's "who changed what and when".
 *
 * Written from the same server action as the change itself rather than from a
 * database trigger, on purpose: a trigger can see the rows but not the person.
 * This app acts as `service_role`, so at the database level a partner's edit
 * and an administrator's are indistinguishable. The only place the actor is
 * actually known is here — which matters more in this app than in the console,
 * because it is the only record of which partner touched what.
 *
 * Deliberately best-effort. A failed audit write must not roll back a
 * successful edit — losing the record of a change is bad, losing the change is
 * worse — so failures are logged and swallowed. If the trail ever needs to be
 * load-bearing, that is a trigger plus a session variable, not a try/catch.
